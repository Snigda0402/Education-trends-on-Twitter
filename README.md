# Education trends on Twitter

## Objective : 
By analyzing a massive collection of education-related tweets, the project explores whether higher tweet volumes correspond to significant trends in the education sector.

## Skills/Tools Used : 

1. Python Programming Language
2. PySpark
3. Google Cloud Platform
5. Big Data Analysis
   
## Project Overview :

- Performing twitterer identification, location analysis, timeline analysis and tweets
uniqueness.

**1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - The dataset was given by the University that I am studying in (University of Chicago). It consists of ~100 million Tweets (~500GB).  These tweets are collected on the topics of education, schools, universities, learning, knowledge sharing, etc., but only a fraction of them would be directly related to either primary, secondary or higher education.
   - Combine individual JSON files and process them for analysis.
   - Discard irrelevant tweets to focus on education-related content.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conduct a comprehensive EDA to identify key variables suitable for profiling Twitter users.
   - Identify fields that provide insights into message volume, retweets, and more.
   - Discard poorly populated variables to streamline analysis.

**3. Perform Analysis on following topics :**
   - Author identification
   - Geographical Distribution Analysis
   - Timeline Analysis
   - Message Uniqueness Analysis
